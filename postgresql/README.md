# Postgresql

This postgresql plan supports standalone and clustered modes as well as continuous archiving via wal-e integration.

## Standalone

To run a standalone postgresql instance simply run `hab start starkandwayne/postgresql` or `docker run starkandwayne/postgresql` if you want to bring up the pre-exported docker image.
